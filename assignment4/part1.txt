bits for virtual memory: 32 bits
virtual memory: 11123456
bits for physical memory: 18 bits
page size: 4096 = 2^12 bytes
In memory there are: 2^32 / 2^12 = 2^20 pages 
Bits for the pages #: 20 bits
Bits for the displacement: 32 – 20 = 12 bits, so the least significant 12 bits are the displacement, which is 456 (base 16)
The page # is the most significant 20 bits, which is 11123 (base 16)
The number of bits of the physical page number is 18 – 12 = 6 bits

Then, use page number, 11123 (base16), as an index into page table, derives the base address of the frame. Next, add the displacement: 456 (base 16) so we can get the physical address. 

Software operations:
Page table management: the OS manages page table data structure, mapping virtual page numbers to physical page frame numbers.
Page table lookup: When a virtual address is generated by a process, the OS uses the virtual page number to index into the page table to retrieve the corresponding physical page frame number.
Address calculation: The OS combines the physical page frame number with the displacement to calculate the physical address.

Hardware operations:
Memory access: The hardware is responsible for accessing the corresponding physical memory location based on the virtual memory.
Address translation: The hardware performs the translation of the virtual address to the physical address. Includes separating the virtual address into the page number and displacement, looking up the page number in the page table, and combining the physical page frame number with the displacement to form the physical address.
Page fault handling: In the event of a page, the hardware triggers an interrupt, and the OS intervenes to handle the fault.

p * (0.7 * 20ms + 0.3 * 8ms) + (1-p) * 100ns = 200ns
p = 6.1 * 10^(-6)
